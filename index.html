  <div class="entry-content"><p>Included file &#8216;JB/setup&#8217; not found in _includes directory
As you surely noticed already a few weeks ago, Project Honey Pot announced that they&#8217;re now also <a href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org/5days_tuesday.php">tracking Comment Spammers</a>. And they&#8217;re doing it quite successfully, the current rate of newly catched spammers is around 100 per day. Part of the success is for sure the the http:BL Plugin for WordPress, which can be grabbed <a href="http://stepien.com.pl/2007/04/28/httpbl_wordpress_plugin/">here</a>. Which made http:BL more known, and in order to use this Plugin you need a Project Honey Pot Account and if you have an account it&#8217;s not much work to get your own Honey Pot.</p>

<h3>http:BL the success</h3>

<p>Many users from http:BL WP Plugin reported that their daily Spam value dropped dramatically from 100 and above, to just a handful Spam Comments per day, some also report that they don&#8217;t receive any Spam at all after setting up this Plugin and Service.<br/>
For myself I got some similar figure but not too successful at all, my Spam count is still around 15-20 per day, but the amount dropped around 66%.</p>

<h2>Remedy</h2>

<p>After just a short time delay, new Spammer IPs will be caught and everyone who uses the http:BL Plugin profits from it, as the service(-Plugin) will block the attempts. So your Website will not receive any Spam and also the traffic, to the site can be lowered, for some heavy traffic pages it will have a big affect and will be a real mercy. One of the main aims is further to reach some Level of Informations about some Spammer/Bot Networks to start lawsuits against them.<br/>
That could lower the amount of daily Spam, although it&#8217;s a long and hard way to this date. So some day, we can live without Spamming at all. It&#8217;s our <strong>remedy</strong>!</p>

<h2>Painkiller</h2>

<p>The other facts are: Much Spam is coming from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_PC">Zombie Computers</a>, and these are just the PCs of poor unsuspecting Internet Users. Which behave just like normal PC Users, who gets everytime he logs into the internet another IP.<br/>
http:BL only logs and blocks the exact spammy IP, and after a few days of no Spam from this IP it&#8217;s supposed to be clean. So if a Zombie enters the Internet, he mostly gets an innocent IP, the user stays connected for some time and sends 10 Spam posts(without his knowledge), where 3 off them reach the Blog. The IP is now blocked&#8230;but not the next time he connects to the Internet, he will be mostly innocent again&#8230;and there are millions of Zombies out. Now just imagine that this problem just gets even bigger when IPv6 makes it way into the wide world.<br/>
http:BL is just a painkiller which makes it liveable with Spam, at least for Users which use http:BL.</p>

<h3>From Painkiller to remedy</h3>

<p>You see there are some easy to see positive effects, but these alone will not stop Spam at all. To succeed the competition against spam, we need a world wide Anti Spam Act, which enables it from everywhere in the world to start a lawsuit against Spammer and that they can nowhere hide, any more. As well it&#8217;s important to make the Internet Users more awake to keep Anti-Virus and -Malware Applications up to date, to not end as Zombie. As well as the use of http:BL or similar tools need to be spread to a wide range of websites to make it gainless for Spammer to Spam, also if they&#8217;re using just Zombies, as the risk to be catched is too high.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s possible to get the Web mostly Spam free, but it will take much work, and not from just a handful Website owner, to achieve it. Mostly it will be that we have to use some protections for ever, as the less we try to fight them the more Spam will be. Equal what will happen, to successful fight Spam, now, you need to participate to http:BL or similar projects. Together we can stand Spam.</p>

Aren&#8217;t you bugged of all this evil around you and in the world? Not Even the Internet is a nice place.<br/>
Everywhere are phisher, Spammer, Harvester, Viruses, Trojans and so on. But that&#8217;s no reason not to give some love to your visitors by handling them over some sweet( for sure in digital kind!).<br/>
I mean if no one starts to be nice, the web never changes.</p>

<h2>Who sweets deserve</h2>

<p>So who deserves sweets? These who deserve sweets are a minority within our web community. Although they&#8217;re just a small part they have much influence and visit more websites within a week than most of us do within their live!<br/>
These good labourers deserve some sweets for their hard work. I mean they visit each and every link. Although links a normal user Never see! Because the normal user just visits your site skin-deep, but this minority finds every link! And that&#8217;s not all they do, they fill our email boxes with live and long awaited content, bring comments to our blogs and forums. They really deserve something. Something <strong>SPECIAL</strong>!</p>

<h2>How to give some sweet</h2>

<p>How do we give them now sweets? As we know they&#8217;re the only ones who find each and every link. Therefore why should a normal user be able to find the way to the sweets too? To block this we put simply some &#8220;hidden sweet links&#8221; to our website, which just these labourer find.<br/>
And behind this link they find the paradise. Some unused Email addresses! And they turn happy and know why they&#8217;re working so hard!</p>

<h2>They&#8217;re getting what they deserve!</h2>

<p>After they found the sweets, they&#8217;re tracked and as soon as they use this unused email you can block the IPs which use it. That works not only for Harvesters and Spam Mails. No, you can now also fight with this way Spammer. Project Honey Pot which just signed a <a href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org/5days_thursday.php">1$ Billion Lawsuit</a> has also ways to find and block Comment Spammer.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<h3>Setting up your own Honey Pot</h3>

<p>Setting up your own honey Pot to trap the evil is as easy as uploading an additional page or editing the template of your blog.<br/>
At first you need an <a href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org">account</a>.<br/>
After that you can install your own honey pot. Just define in what language the file shall be written, as well as some other informations. Download the file, Upload the file. View the file, Follow the instructions and visit the link. And you&#8217;re done. Now you need only to add some links to your websites so that Crawlers can find them.<br/>
If you don&#8217;t own webspace you need only to be able to edit the template files and add Quicklinks to your theme.<br/>
Quicklinks are links to other Honey Pots. After these few steps you run your own Honey pot, which catches Harvester, Spam Server, and Comment Spammer. At Project Honey Pot you can track your trap.</p>

<h3>How to profit from the Data</h3>

<p>Ok with the current Information you don&#8217;t profit in anyway, except that the Spammer, maybe some day will be sued. Another Press Release from Project Honey Pot was http:BL. With this Blacklist API you can send the Visitor IP to Project Honey Pot. There it&#8217;s compared with the collected data. After that you get a result back, where you can find out if and when, which Type the malicious server is. Also you can find out, when the IP was last time active(maybe they Spammer moved to another IP and the visitor is legit?). And how much he scores within Threat and Damage.<br/>
Depending on that Information you can decide either to block the access attempt or allow it.</p>

<h3>Which software does already make use of it?</h3>

<p>There&#8217;s a good version for <a href="http://stepien.com.pl/2007/04/28/httpbl_wordpress_plugin/">WordPress</a><br/>
And for phpBB is a Knowledge article <a href="http://www.phpbb.com/kb/article/httpbl-on-phpbb-fight-back-against-spammers/">available</a></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Try to install a honey Pot at your Website or at least try to link to one. The more we are the more we have impact on it. Maybe we can get the Web a cleaner place to stay! Install http:BL Plugins/Mods to protect your website from these evil.</p>

Are you bored and don&#8217;t know what to do? Ever tried to have fun while working with Google?<br/>
No?<br/>
You have to try it, it can be real fun!</p>

<h3><a href="http://google.com/codesearch">Google Code Search</a></h3>

<p>This service was made public by Google in October last year. The sense behind this feature is to make it easier for programmer to search for Code examples. The Source Code which you get as result was crawled by Google at websites all over the web. The Source Code you can view is open source, so no copyright problems are caused.</p>

<h4>How you have fun</h4>

<p>As you surely as developer of programs know it&#8217;s sometimes the hell to get your code working. And as it seems many programmer want to remember this also years after creation, when they have to work with the code again. If you search for damn, fuck, and other 4 letter words and other expressions you find many funny statements. You can see some of them at this website: <a href="http://webthreads.de/2006/10/google-code-search-oder-wie-finde-ich-lustige-kommentare">webthreads.de</a>.<br/>
Don&#8217;t think you find no comments about persons who haven&#8217;t to do anything with programming. So let&#8217;s see what you can get by crawling for <strong>George W Bush</strong>:</p>

<blockquote><p>   85:   AddReply([&#8217; george &#8216;, &#8217; bush &#8216;], [</p>

<pre><code>     'Bush, this man is a war criminal, and we will see that he is brought to trial.';  
      , 'The leader of the international criminal gang of bastards.';  
</code></pre>

<p>  790: ;; MORAL-II: Redefining somebody else&#8217;s advice is BAAAAD (to speak with</p>

<pre><code>   ;; George Walker Bush), and why would you redefine your own advice anyway?  
   ;; Advice is a mechanism to facilitate function redefinition, not advice
</code></pre></blockquote>

<h3>Let&#8217;s talk with <a href="http://douweosinga.com/projects/googletalk">Google</a></h3>

<p>Googles search Engine is already able to talk with you! Visit <a href="http://douweosinga.com/projects/googletalk">douweosinga</a> and you&#8217;ll see that this is possible.</p>

<h4>How it works</h4>

<p>It&#8217;s totally simple at the website above you simply write 3 or 4 words into a Textbox. The script searches then at Google and returns you for the first search Result the first Word after the term given by yours. Now it removes the first word of your word group and searches after it again, with the first returned word added. Also this time is the first word after the group taken and added to your sentence, as well as it is now part of the search term. And so on.<br/>
So you get often funny sentences, which end everytime, just a question of time, after a while as mess.<br/>
As the search results for the terms changes just as the web changes your results can be tomorrow totally different than they were today.<br/>
So for example I got from Google (<strong>Bold</strong> are my words):<br/>
* <strong> <strong>George Bush drinks</strong> the Blood of the Jews and Poles.</strong><br/>
* <strong> <strong>bill gates plan</strong> to Win the War on terror, as a tool for learning. and Teaching. in the Social Sciences.</strong> &#8211; That&#8217;s the answer to the question why the hell MS products are so expensive. we help to fight terrorism!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>As you see you can get alot of fun with Googles services. So why don&#8217;t you try it for yourself? It&#8217;s worth a look!<br/>

Google <a href="http://code.google.com/webstats/index.html">crawled in 2005</a> around a billion pages to find out what Tags and Tag attributes are used within them.</p></p>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>So this Study shows for example that within the &lt;html&gt; the attribute <strong>xml:lang</strong> is quite often used, but it&#8217;s totally senseless within a HTML Document as no HTML processor does look at it.<br/>
It also shows that many people aren&#8217;t able to write values within quotes, so mostly wrong attributes and values for them would be the answer.<br/>
As you also can find out is that the meta name <strong>revisit-after</strong> is useless as just one Spider ever looked at this attribute.</p>

<h3>Do we need this for SEO?!</h3>

<p>What I personally found really interesting is this Sentence about meta attributes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Next we have two name values: keywords, which these days is mostly useless, ironically, and description, which is still somewhat useful.<br/>
Does that mean that parts of SEO, like the meta SEO is totally senseless, as these tags aren&#8217;t taken serious any more?</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Look is the Content</h3>

<p>As we already know Tables are misused by many websites and templates for designing purpose, therefore most attributes uses within them are just for presentation. But that applies also for to the body tag. As you also can see from these results most pages still use the attributes to define the Styling rather than css to do this.</p>

<h3>Hyper Text Mark-up Langauge is Difficult</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s really interesting to see how many misspell attributes just one example is the above already misspelled Language which can be found in a lot of versions on the internet. And what I didn&#8217;t know for myself you don&#8217;t need to add even the language attribute to the script tag, as there&#8217;s just one valid language for it!</p>

<h3>I need my own Tag attribute</h3>

<p>The last thing I want to mention is the quite big amount of self invented tags, which comes from Adobe GoLive, MicroSoft Office and some more. Where I can&#8217;t see any sense behind it as these tags aren&#8217;t supported by Browser, or mostly not supported. So what are they for?</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>To write 100% HTML 4.01 Mark-up is a lot of work and needs much attention. Not only when you have written it also after you published it. Maybe HTML isn&#8217;t for everyone, and you may need a HTML Expert, to be able to publish HTML code.<br/>
Take a look at the Study for yourself, it&#8217;s worth looking.</p></p>

I&#8217;m happy to announce that the <strong>Tip: Fake-Transparency for UserControls</strong>, is taken as Tip of the Week 24.10-30.10 on the biggest german Website for VisualBasic, <a href="http://vbarchiv.net">Vb@rchiv.net</a>.<br/>
I feel me now a bit proud and I&#8217;m strengthened that my work, what I do isn&#8217;t so worse as I sometimes see it.<br/>
I hope that my following tips I will someday release and other coding work will connect on this success.</p>
